# Title: **Lighting Transformation Program**

## **Description**:
### This program will take an image, and change the color palette of it to match a desired theme. Themes can include sunset, underwater, valentine's, and etc. This code relates to digital arts because it allows users to customize any image to fit a requirement.

## **Features**:
### Pillow Module, Image Module, and other Image manipulation tactics.
### I will use this features in order to have set lighting themes ready for the user to choose. Settings will often include adjusting luminosity, colors, image sharpness, and more.

## **Challenges**:
### Some challenges I may run into include how I'm going to call a user-specific lighting pattern that I may not have ready or in a custom library. There's so many different lighting themes to list I won't be able to list one the user may want, so figuring out a code that pulls from the internet for a specific lighting pattern may be difficult.

## **Outcomes**:
### My ideal outcome would be that the user type in a combination of words to indicate the theme they would like to transform their image to, and the program would output a readjusted image to that said theme. 
### Worst casinario, the bare essentials I would like for my program to be able to do, is the user would be able to transform their image based on a list of around 10-15 themes available to them, to which I have created and set up on my own.

## **Milestones**:
### **Week 1**: Complete 80-90% of psuedocode
### **Week 2**: Complete psuedocode, start writing code, and create a custom library of default lighting themes
### **Week 3**: Figure out a code/module that will allow you to pull from the internet of other lighting themes the user may wish for
### **Week 4**: Finish code and testing, as well as figure out if pulling from the internet works or not.
